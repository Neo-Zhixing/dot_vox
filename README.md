Rust parser for [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/) .vox files, using
[Nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom).

## Current status

As of version 3.0.0, we no longer support files with the old `MATT` chunk. If you wish to use 
v3.0.0, please open your file in the latest version of MagicaVoxel and resave - this should 
switch you over to the newer dictionary-based `MATL` chunks. Alternatively, continue to use 
v2.0.0.

The [Dust Engine](https://github.com/dust-engine) project is currently maintaining this crate.
If there are any changes in the MagicaVoxel file format, feel free to open an issue or a PR, and we'll work to get them implemented.
